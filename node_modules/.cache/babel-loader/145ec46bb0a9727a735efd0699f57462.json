I often felt embarrassed when I didn't already know these things which made it difficult to ask questions, but it was always useful when I did. I would warn that if it's a lot easier for them that they might try to take over the assignment. I would recommend talking with your partners before you get to work about how you plan to divide the assignments, work in the same room, and update each other about your progress. </p>\n        <p>The only class I felt put in a disadvantage, and I heard other people who did not major in Computer Science say they felt similarly, is Algorithms and Data Structures. For this course I would recommend a ton of practice problems. The flip side of going to such a new school is disorganization and making it up as you go. When asked for practice problems, the teacher responded that the midterm was not even made yet let alone practice problems. Therefore, if you are not too familiar with algorithms, I would recommend spending some time beforehand learning and practicing. </p>\n        <p>I have directly heard someone from admissions say that they look for Linear Algebra knowledge. If you don't have that on your transcript, you should take an online course and mention it in your application. Linear Algebra is the foundation of a lot of computer science. I used this <a href=\"http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf\">Linear Algebra review</a> as a helpful refresher.</p>\n        \n        <h3>Are there any scholarships?</h3>\n        <p>I was afforded 2 scholarships. One was a merit-based scholarship that Cornell Tech offered me along with my acceptance. This did not require a separate scholarship application. The other was through Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY). They offer 3 scholarships each year to those that identify as women and are in the Computer Science, Operation Research, and Electrical Engineering programs specifically for Cornell Tech. They send you an application after you apply. I am not sure how applying at later rounds affects the likelihood of getting a scholarship. </p>\n\n        <h3>What is WiTNY?</h3>\n        <p>I would definitely recommend everyone get involved with Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY) now known as Break Through Tech! There are events for women on campus and ways to volunteer to help CUNY students. I continue to volunteer by helping CUNY women with resume reviews. <b>You do not have to be a woman to mentor women.</b> Given that tech is mostly composed of men, it is imperative that men serve as mentors. When I went to CT, the Computer Science program was only 25% women. Though typical of tech, it sucks! Especially in a small school, I was often the only woman in a room. I encourage women to apply, and we can all work togehter to make the field more inclusive!</p>\n\n        <h3>How much experience do students typically have coming into the program?</h3>\n        <p>I had two years of work experience prior to starting which I believe to be true for most Computer Science students. I am personally glad that I took a couple years after undergrad. It helped me realize what I was looking for out of the program and make the most of my time there. There were people from straight out of college through 5 years out. Wherever you are in the spectrum, you'll be just fine and there will be others like you!  </p>\n\n        <h3>I'm going! How do I make the best of my experience?</h3>\n        <p>Congratulations! I am excited for you!</p>\n          \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Blog;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
